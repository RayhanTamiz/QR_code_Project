1.
A XML file will be created from user input.

2.
To sign a perticular XML file , using openssl linux toolwe wil generate public/private key pair (x.key) and a certificate signing request (x.csr ) file .

3.
using previously generated  x.csr file , we will create a certificate file ( x.crt ) on openssl tool .

4.
Now we will sign that XML file with the certificate(x.crt) file and the key(x.key) file using Xmlsectool .

5.
Then we converted the signed_Xml file into QR code using goole ZXing ("Zebra Crossing") library in java .

6.
In this processs we take a pre-determinded XSL style sheet to format the XML file and QRcode image  into a HTML file using "xmlto" tool .

7.
We used "wkhtmltopdf" tool to convert the HTML file into PDF file.

8.
we read  the QRcode from the printed paper using mobile camera or any convention QRcode Reader available in the market 

9.
Then we convert the QRcode in XML formate using zxing library .

10.
Finally we verify the xml document signature with the previously generated certificate file using "xmlsectool" .
